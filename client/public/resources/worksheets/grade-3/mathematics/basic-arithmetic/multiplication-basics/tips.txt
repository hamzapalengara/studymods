Hints:

Visualize the multiplication as repeated addition: For example, 4 x 6 can be thought of as adding 4 six times: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24.
Use a multiplication table: If you have a multiplication table handy, you can look up the answer for each problem.
Practice your multiplication facts: The more you practice, the easier it will become to remember the answers.
Additional Tips:

Start with smaller numbers: If you're struggling with larger numbers, start with smaller ones and gradually work your way up.
Break down larger numbers: If you're multiplying a larger number, break it down into smaller parts. For example, 7 x 8 can be broken down into 7 x 4 + 7 x 4.
