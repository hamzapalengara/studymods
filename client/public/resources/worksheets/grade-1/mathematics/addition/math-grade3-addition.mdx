## Understanding Addition

Addition means combining numbers together. When we add numbers, the result is called the sum.

<Math formula="3 + 4 = 7" />

Let's practice with some questions:

<Question
  id="1"
  type="number"
  points={2}
  correctAnswer={8}
>
  What is 5 + 3?
</Question>

<Diagram src="/images/apples.svg" />

<Question
  id="2"
  type="multiple-choice"
  points={3}
  options={[
    "6 apples",
    "7 apples",
    "8 apples",
    "9 apples"
  ]}
  correctAnswer="8 apples"
>
  Looking at the picture above, how many apples are there in total?
</Question>
